# üß™ Comprehensive Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines our complete testing strategy for the CTI Dashboard application, covering manual testing, automated unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

## üìã Test Categories

### 1. Manual Postman Testing (Your Responsibility)
**Purpose:** Test real API endpoints with actual authentication and authorization

#### Authentication Test Cases
- [ ] **Valid login** with correct credentials
- [ ] **Invalid email format** (e.g., "invalid-email")
- [ ] **Empty email/password** fields
- [ ] **Incorrect password** for existing user
- [ ] **Non-existent user** login attempt
- [ ] **SQL injection attempts** in login fields
- [ ] **XSS attempts** in login fields
- [ ] **Rate limiting** on repeated login attempts

#### Authorization Test Cases (for each role: unassigned, viewer, editor, admin)
- [ ] **GET /users** - Should work for admin, fail for others
- [ ] **POST /organizations** - Should work for unassigned, fail for others
- [ ] **PUT /organizations/:id** - Should work for admin, fail for others
- [ ] **DELETE /organizations/:id** - Should work for admin, fail for others
- [ ] **GET /incidents** - Should work for all authenticated users
- [ ] **POST /incidents** - Should work for admin/editor, fail for viewer
- [ ] **DELETE /incidents/:id** - Should work for admin/editor, fail for viewer
- [ ] **GET /threat-actors** - Should work for all authenticated users
- [ ] **POST /threat-actors** - Should work for admin/editor, fail for viewer
- [ ] **DELETE /threat-actors/:id** - Should work for admin/editor, fail for viewer

#### API Endpoint Test Cases
- [ ] **Rate limiting** on AI summary requests (5 per 15 minutes)
- [ ] **CORS headers** present on all endpoints
- [ ] **Error handling** for invalid requests
- [ ] **Data validation** on all POST/PUT requests

  - [x] Invalid token
  - [x] Missing token
  - [x] Admin authorization
  - [x] Viewer restrictions

### 3. Automated E2E Tests (Frontend)

#### Authentication E2E Tests ‚úÖ
- [x] Valid login with correct credentials
- [x] Invalid email format
- [x] Empty email/password
- [x] Incorrect password
- [x] Non-existent user
- [x] SQL injection attempt in login form
- [x] XSS attempt in login form
- [x] Rate limiting on login attempts
- [x] Valid registration
- [x] Insufficient password strength
- [x] Password mismatch
- [x] Unauthorized access to protected routes
- [x] Role-based access control

#### User Workflow Tests (To Add)
- [ ] **Complete user onboarding** (register ‚Üí create org ‚Üí dashboard)
- [ ] **Incident management workflow** (create ‚Üí edit ‚Üí delete)
- [ ] **Threat actor tracking** (create ‚Üí update ‚Üí delete)
- [ ] **CVE monitoring** (fetch ‚Üí filter ‚Üí view details)
- [ ] **AI summary generation** (generate ‚Üí view ‚Üí export)

#### UI/UX Tests (To Add)
- [ ] **Responsive design** on different screen sizes
- [ ] **Dark/light theme** switching
- [ ] **Form validation** on all inputs
- [ ] **Loading states** and error handling
- [ ] **Navigation** between pages

### 4. Security Tests

#### Input Validation Tests
- [ ] **SQL injection** attempts on all forms
- [ ] **XSS** attempts on all inputs
- [ ] **CSRF** protection
- [ ] **Input sanitization** on all endpoints

#### Authentication Security Tests
- [ ] **Token expiration** handling
- [ ] **Session management**
- [ ] **Password strength** requirements
- [ ] **Account lockout** after failed attempts

#### Authorization Security Tests
- [ ] **Privilege escalation** attempts
- [ ] **Cross-organization** data access prevention
- [ ] **Role manipulation** attempts

### 5. Performance Tests

#### API Performance Tests
- [ ] **Response time** under normal load
- [ ] **Rate limiting** effectiveness
- [ ] **Database query** optimization
- [ ] **Memory usage** monitoring

#### Frontend Performance Tests
- [ ] **Page load times**
- [ ] **Bundle size** optimization
- [ ] **Image optimization**
- [ ] **Caching** effectiveness

## üöÄ Test Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Manual Testing (You)
1. **Set up Postman collections** for each user role
2. **Test all authentication scenarios** listed above
3. **Test all authorization scenarios** for each endpoint
4. **Document any issues** found

### Phase 2: Automated Testing (We'll build together)
1. **Run existing unit tests** to ensure they pass
2. **Add missing integration tests** for critical paths
3. **Expand E2E test coverage** for user workflows
4. **Add security test cases** for vulnerability prevention

### Phase 3: CI/CD Integration
1. **Configure GitHub Actions** to run all tests
2. **Set up test reporting** and coverage metrics
3. **Add test failure notifications**
4. **Ensure tests run on every PR**

## üìä Test Coverage Goals

- **Unit Tests:** 80%+ coverage of business logic
- **Integration Tests:** All API endpoints covered
- **E2E Tests:** All critical user workflows covered
- **Security Tests:** All common vulnerabilities tested
